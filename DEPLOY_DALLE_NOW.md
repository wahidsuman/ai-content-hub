# 🚀 DEPLOY DALL-E CODE NOW (2 minutes)

The DALL-E fixes are written but NOT deployed because GitHub Actions is broken!

## Option 1: Direct Cloudflare Dashboard (FASTEST - 1 minute)

1. **Go to:** https://dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → `ai-website-manager`
2. **Click:** "Quick edit" button
3. **DELETE everything** in the editor
4. **Copy ALL code from:** `/workspace/COPY_TO_CLOUDFLARE.js`
5. **Paste** it in the Cloudflare editor
6. **Click:** "Save and Deploy"

✅ DALL-E will work immediately!

## Option 2: Manual Wrangler Deploy (2 minutes)

From your terminal:
```bash
cd /workspace/worker
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
wrangler deploy
```

## Option 3: Fix GitHub Actions (5 minutes)

The issue is the KV namespace ID in wrangler.toml doesn't match!

1. **Get the correct ID:**
   - Go to KV → `_agaminews-workers_sites_assets`
   - Copy its ID

2. **Update wrangler.toml:**
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "NEWS_KV"
id = "PASTE_THE_CORRECT_ID_HERE"
```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix KV namespace ID"
git push
```

## 🎯 Why Unsplash Still Shows:

- ❌ OLD code (with Unsplash) is deployed
- ✅ NEW code (with DALL-E) is written but not deployed
- 🚫 GitHub Actions can't deploy due to KV ID mismatch

**Use Option 1 - Just copy/paste the code directly in Cloudflare Dashboard!**
