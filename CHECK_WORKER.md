# Quick Check - Find Your Active Worker

## Just tell me this ONE thing:

Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com

1. Click on your domain (agaminews.in)
2. On the left sidebar, click "Workers Routes"
3. You'll see something like:
   ```
   Route: agaminews.in/*
   Worker: [WORKER NAME HERE]
   ```

**What's the worker name shown there?**

Common names might be:
- ai-website-manager
- ai-content-hub
- news-bot
- agaminews-worker
- Or something else

Once you tell me the name, I'll fix the deployment automatically - no copy/pasting needed!
