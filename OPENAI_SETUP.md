## Quality Difference

### Without OpenAI:
```
"Markets are buzzing because Latest developments in this 
business story are unfolding rapidly. Keep an eye on this one."
```

### With OpenAI GPT-4o:
```
"The Sensex surge past 75,000 marks a psychological milestone 
that has fund managers reassessing their India allocation. 
Foreign institutional investors pumped in ₹3,000 crores this 
week alone, primarily into banking and IT stocks. What's 
driving this? The RBI's steady stance on rates coupled with 
strong Q3 earnings from TCS and Infosys. Retail investors 
should note that while momentum is strong, the market is 
now trading at 22x forward earnings - historically high 
territory. Smart money is rotating into mid-caps, particularly 
in the EV and renewable energy space."
```
