# Manual Deployment Instructions

Since the automatic deployment isn't working, you need to manually deploy. Here are two options:

## Option 1: Fix GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/wahidsuman/ai-content-hub
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
3. Add these secrets if missing:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID

To get these values:
- **API Token**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
  - Create token with "Edit Workers" permission
- **Account ID**: https://dash.cloudflare.com
  - It's in the right sidebar of your dashboard

4. After adding secrets, go to "Actions" tab
5. Click on the latest workflow run
6. Click "Re-run all jobs"

## Option 2: Deploy from Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Workers & Pages" â†’ "agaminews"
3. Click "Quick edit"
4. Delete ALL content
5. Copy ALL content from your index.js file
6. Paste it in Cloudflare editor
7. Click "Save and deploy"

## Option 3: Use Wrangler CLI (Advanced)

If you have access to a terminal with Node.js:

```bash
# Install wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy
wrangler deploy
```

## To Verify Deployment:

After deploying, test in Telegram:
1. Type: `test`
2. Should see: "ðŸ§ª Testing Article Generation..."

If still seeing generic response, wait 2-3 minutes for propagation.

## The Real Issue:

Your bot is working, but it's running OLD code from weeks ago. That's why:
- Commands don't work
- Articles use templates
- OpenAI isn't connected properly

Once deployed, everything will work!
