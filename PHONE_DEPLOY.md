### Step 3: Check First Line

- Anything else ‚Üí Old code ‚ùå

### Step 4: If Old Code, Update It
1. Click: **Settings** tab (not Quick edit)
2. Scroll down to: **Deployments**
3. Look for the latest deployment
4. Click: **Manage deployment** ‚Üí **Promote to production**

## Check If It Worked:
Send `/help` to your bot - you should see buttons!

## Still Not Working?
The GitHub deployment is broken. You need to either:
1. Fix GitHub Actions secrets
2. Deploy from a computer
3. Use Cloudflare API from phone (complex)

Let me know what you see in the Quick Edit - is it Version 2.0 or old code?
