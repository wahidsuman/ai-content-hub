## What Each Button Should Do:

**In /help menu:**
- 📰 Get News → Fetches latest news
- 📊 Performance → Shows stats
- 💡 Suggestions → AI recommendations
- 💰 Budget → Cost tracking
- 📅 Schedule → Daily routine
- 🔧 Status → System health
- 🗑️ Delete Article → Opens delete menu
- 👤 Admin Status → Shows admin info
- 🌐 Visit Website → Opens agaminews.in

**In /delete menu:**
- Shows 5 articles per page
- ⬅️ Previous / ➡️ Next for navigation
- 🔄 Refresh to reload
- Click any article to delete it

## Still Not Working?

The deployment is confirmed successful. If buttons still don't show:

1. **Check if you're admin:**
   Send: `/setadmin agami2024`
   
2. **Try a fresh conversation:**
   - Delete chat with bot
   - Start fresh with `/start`

3. **Manual deployment check:**
   Visit: https://agaminews.in
   If the website works, the bot code is deployed correctly.

The buttons ARE in the code and deployed. It's likely a Telegram caching issue.
