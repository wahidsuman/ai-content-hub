## 📱 Fix Everything in 3 Steps (From Mobile)

### Step 1: Get Your Chat ID
1. Open this URL in your mobile browser:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot8122631689:AAGgmT7PGYcRrs7hzyO4aqGWhujA5oXH2Kk/getUpdates
```
2. Look for `"chat":{"id":` followed by numbers
3. Save that number (your Chat ID)

### Step 2: Update Cloudflare Worker
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate: Workers & Pages → ai-website-manager
3. Click "Quick Edit"
4. Delete all code
5. Copy code from `agaminews_bot_complete.js` file
6. Paste it
7. Save and Deploy

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In Worker Settings → Variables, add:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` = 8122631689:AAGgmT7PGYcRrs7hzyO4aqGWhujA5oXH2Kk
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` = [Your OpenAI key from platform.openai.com]
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` = [Your chat ID from Step 1]

Optional: Create KV namespace "agaminews-budget" for tracking costs
